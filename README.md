Use:
Click the repective keys on your keyboard OR simply just click on the buttons with your mouse
Can also be used on mobile - the website is made responsive.

Resources Used:
I have used HTML CSS and only Vanilla JS for this project.
I used DOM manipulation for assigning the class to click events as well as keydown events.
For keypad events, I have used switch cases insted of if statements.
